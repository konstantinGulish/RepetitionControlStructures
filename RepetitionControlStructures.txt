Can't Get Enough of Program Design

1.
ALGORITHM:
The program receives 15 measurements and converts them to metric equivalent.
After all measurements are entered the messsage "All measurements processed" shall be displayed on the screen. 

INPUTS: 
15 measurements

PROCESSING
convert each measurement to metric

OUTPUT
metric equivalent for each of measurements and "All measurements processed"  messsage.

PSEUDOCODE
counter = 0
DO WHILE counter < 15
	promt for and read in a measurement
	convert measurement to metric
	display the result in metric
	move to the next line
	counter = counter + 1
ENDDO
Display "All measurements processed"
